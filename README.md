# GIFYouAKnuckleSammy
An app I developed for the UofM Coding Bootcamp that showcases the giphy.com developer API.  Users are able to search predfined categories, create and search their own categories, and clear the screen.  Each still image can be clicked to see it in animated GIF form.

## Deployed At
### https://leavinit.github.io/GIFYouAKnuckleSammy/

## Technologies Used
- JQuery : A JavaScript library to dramatically ease both visual display (CSS, DOM manipulation) and off-site requests (AJAX calls to the GIPHY.com api)
- BootStrap : A CSS framework to standarize the look and feel of the site and also provide mobile responsiveness
- GIPHY.com Dev Api:  An interface maintained by GIPHY.com to allow developers programatic access to that site's assets and functionality
